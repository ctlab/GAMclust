# GAM-clustering

GAMclust is a tool for metabolic GAM-clustering analysis of 

* bulk RNA-seq data, 
* single cell RNA-seq data,
* spatial RNA-seq data.

> The GAM-clustering method reveals metabolic variability within dataset using a novel network-based computational approach. This method utilizes cellular transcriptional profiles as proxies. The metabolic network of reactions is presented as a graph. This graph has vertices corresponding to metabolites and the edges corresponding to the reactions with the expressed genes. In the graph the method tries to find a set of connected subgraphs. Genes of each connected subgraph have highly correlated expression pattern.
