Description: The GAM-clustering method reveals metabolic variability within dataset using a novel 
    network-based computational approach. This method utilizes cellular transcriptional profiles as 
    proxies. The metabolic network of reactions is presented as a graph. This graph has vertices 
    corresponding to metabolites and the edges corresponding to the reactions with the expressed genes. 
    In the graph the method tries to find a set of connected subgraphs. Genes of each connected subgraph 
    have highly correlated expression pattern.
